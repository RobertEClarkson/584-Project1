Based on a free email test site I found. My email is mostly working. The columns and other elements are responsive to screen size and move accordingly. The main button on my email still has the keyframe animation and the radio/checkboxes still work. However, my images do not, and I am pretty sure it's because I saved them to the repository itself rather than taking images hosted somewhere like on unsplash.com
